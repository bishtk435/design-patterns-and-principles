# Design Patterns and Principles

Welcome to this comprehensive repository of software design patterns and principles! This repository serves as a reference guide for developers who want to understand and apply common design patterns and principles in their code.

## Overview

Good software design is essential for creating maintainable, scalable, and robust applications. This repository covers:

1. **Design Patterns**: Proven solutions to common problems in software design
2. **Design Principles**: Fundamental rules and guidelines for writing good code

## Design Patterns

Design patterns are categorized into three main groups:

### Creational Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### Structural Patterns
These patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

### Behavioral Patterns
These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

## Design Principles

### SOLID Principles
A set of five principles that help developers design maintainable and extendable software:
- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
- **O**pen/Closed Principle
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
This principle aims to reduce repetition of code and information in a codebase.

## How to Use This Repository

Each pattern and principle is documented in its own markdown file with:
- An explanation of the concept
- TypeScript code examples
- Use cases and applications
- Advantages and disadvantages
- Related patterns/principles
