# Introduction to SOLID Principles

## What Are SOLID Principles?

SOLID is an acronym coined by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) that represents five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were introduced in his 2000 paper "Design Principles and Design Patterns."

The SOLID principles are:

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## Why Are SOLID Principles Important?

Following the SOLID principles leads to code that is:

- **Maintainable**: Easier to understand and modify without breaking other parts of the system.
- **Extensible**: Easier to add new features without modifying existing code.
- **Testable**: Easier to write unit tests for individual components.
- **Reusable**: Components can be reused in different contexts.
- **Robust**: Less prone to bugs and more resilient to changes.

## Brief Overview of Each Principle

### 1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class should have only one reason to change.

This principle states that a class should have only one job or responsibility. If a class has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled, making it harder to maintain and more prone to bugs when changes are made.

### 2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

This principle encourages designing your modules to be extended without having to modify the module itself. This is typically achieved through the use of abstractions and polymorphism.

### 3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

This principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. It ensures that a subclass can stand in for its superclass.

### 4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

This principle deals with the disadvantages of "fat" interfaces. Classes that implement interfaces should not be forced to implement methods they don't need. Instead, large interfaces should be split into smaller, more specific ones.

### 5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
> Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

This principle focuses on decoupling software modules. By depending on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, your code becomes more flexible and easier to maintain.

## How to Use This Section

Each SOLID principle has its own dedicated file with:

1. **Detailed Explanation**: A comprehensive description of the principle.
2. **Code Examples**: TypeScript examples showing violations and adherence to the principle.
3. **Benefits**: The advantages of following the principle.
4. **Real-world Applications**: How the principle applies to real software development.
5. **Common Pitfalls**: Mistakes to avoid when trying to implement the principle.

## Beyond SOLID

While SOLID principles are fundamental, they are not the only principles to consider when designing software. They work well in conjunction with other principles like DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself), KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It).

In the following sections, we'll explore each SOLID principle in detail with TypeScript examples.
