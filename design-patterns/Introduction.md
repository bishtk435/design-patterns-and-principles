# Introduction to Design Patterns

## What Are Design Patterns?

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems that software developers face during software design. They represent best practices evolved over time by experienced software developers. Design patterns are not finished designs that can be directly transformed into code; they are templates that describe how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations.

## Why Use Design Patterns?

Design patterns offer several benefits:

1. **Proven Solutions**: Patterns represent solutions that have been refined over time by numerous developers.
2. **Common Vocabulary**: Patterns provide a standard terminology that helps developers communicate more effectively.
3. **Abstraction**: They address issues at the design level rather than at the implementation level.
4. **Reusability**: Patterns promote reuse of successful designs and architectures.
5. **Quality**: They encapsulate expert knowledge and help prevent subtle issues that might not be evident until later in the implementation.

## Types of Design Patterns

Design patterns are traditionally categorized into three main groups:

### 1. Creational Patterns

These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

Examples:
- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object.

### 2. Structural Patterns

These patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

Examples:
- **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
- **Bridge**: Separates an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
- **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- **Decorator**: Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- **Facade**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.
- **Flyweight**: Uses sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently.
- **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### 3. Behavioral Patterns

These patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects.

Examples:
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers.
- **Command**: Turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains all information about the request.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- **Mediator**: Defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact.
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an object's internal state without violating encapsulation.
- **Observer**: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.
- **Visitor**: Represents an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure.

## How to Use This Section

In this repository, each design pattern has its own dedicated file with:

1. **Intent**: The problem the pattern is trying to solve.
2. **Structure**: UML diagrams and TypeScript implementations.
3. **Examples**: Real-world scenarios where the pattern is applicable.
4. **Benefits and Drawbacks**: Advantages and potential disadvantages.
5. **Related Patterns**: Other patterns that are often used with the current pattern.

## Anti-Patterns

It's also worth mentioning that there are "anti-patterns" â€” common approaches that seem like good solutions but actually cause more problems than they solve. Understanding both patterns and anti-patterns helps in making better design decisions.

## When to Use Design Patterns

While design patterns are incredibly useful, they should not be overused. Remember:

> "If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail."

The best approach is to understand the problem thoroughly first, and then determine if a design pattern is appropriate. Using a pattern unnecessarily can lead to overcomplicated code.

In the following sections, we'll explore each design pattern in detail with TypeScript examples.
